                            <p>In the early morning hours, the streets of Chinatown come alive with bustling activity. Steam rises from restaurant kitchens, while delivery trucks packed with fresh ingredients unload their goods.

                            <p>Almost a century ago, these neighborhoods were modest enclaves, offering warmth and belonging to newly arrived immigrants. At the heart of these communities, Chinese restaurants began to flourish. For a population deeply rooted in the belief that “food is the essence of life,” the flavors of home became a powerful remedy for homesickness. Running a Chinese restaurant also became a vital livelihood for many early Chinese immigrants.</p>
                            <p>Today, these establishments are more than just echoes of tradition—they are evolving spaces, embracing innovation to keep pace with the times and fostering cultural fusion in the process.</p>

                            <h2>The History of Chinese Cuisine in America</h2>

                            <p>Chinese cuisine in America carries a rich and complex history, intertwined with the journey of Chinese immigrants. Over decades, it has mirrored the shifting tides of U.S. policies toward China and the evolving experiences of the Chinese diaspora—rising to prominence during some eras and fading into obscurity in others. While rooted in traditional flavors, Chinese food in America has also adapted to local tastes, giving birth to a uniquely “American Chinese” culinary identity. Iconic dishes like chop suey in the early days and the ever-popular General Tso's chicken stand as enduring symbols of this evolution.</p>

                            <h2>The First Impression – Signs and Menus</h2>

                            <p>Have you ever noticed how many Chinese restaurant signs in Chinatowns seem to follow a familiar pattern? Bold red and yellow colors and large Chinese characters accompanied by English translations—it’s a visual signature that feels deeply rooted in tradition.</p>
                            
                            <p>During a walk-through of Boston’s Chinatown, we captured snapshots of the restaurant scene. From the signage to the restaurant names, the atmosphere exudes a distinct sense of “Chineseness.” Some signs even evoke a nostalgic feel reminiscent of China in the 1980s and 1990s. Unlike the eye-catching, internet-savvy names popular in modern Chinese cities, these signs may appear a little dated by comparison.</p>
                        
                            <p>We analyzed over 300 Chinese restaurant names from Boston’s local review platform, "The Real Yellow Pages", and conducted a word frequency analysis. Beyond straightforward translations like "China," "Restaurant," and "Fast Food," as well as regionally inspired terms such as "Hong Kong" and "Mandarin," names featuring words like "Dragon," "Panda," "Garden," "Pearl," "Wok," and "Dumpling" all vividly highlight the restaurants’ strong ties to traditional Chinese culture. </p>

                            <figure class="animate-box">
                                <img src="images/menus.png" alt="Image" style="width: 100%" class="img-responsive">
                            </figure>

                            <p>When it comes to colors, red, yellow, and white dominate. After collecting and analyzing photos of 66 restaurant signs in Boston Chinatown, we found that white was the most common color, appearing in 26.42% of signs, followed closely by red and yellow. White serves as a versatile base, but red is undeniably the color most associated with China. In Chinese culture, red symbolizes good fortune and prosperity—a fitting wish for a business. Yellow, meanwhile, is eye-catching and often associated with gold, symbolizing wealth. </p>
                            <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/20471913"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script><noscript><img src="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/20471913/thumbnail" width="100%" alt="chart visualization" /></noscript></div>

                            <p>In recent years, however, new-wave Chinese restaurants have begun to break away from these traditional aesthetics. Incorporating colors like black, pink, and green into their signage, these establishments offer diners a fresh visual experience.</p>
                            <figure class="animate-box">
                                <img src="images/signs.png" alt="Image" style="width: 100%" class="img-responsive">
                            </figure>

                            <p>Since 2016, there’s been a noticeable uptick in restaurants using black as the dominant background for their signs, often paired with sleek, modern designs. Some even feature witty or poetic phrases inspired by trends in contemporary Chinese pop culture, such as playful taglines like “The breeze from Boston brings memories of you.”</p>
                            <p>We also analyzed the menus of Chinese restaurants in Boston's Chinatown and conducted a word frequency study on all the dish names. After removing common filler words like "from" and other prepositions, we extracted the top 130 most frequently occurring dish components. By categorizing these components into "traditional" and "fusion/nouvelle," we found that traditional dishes still dominate the menus, with "beef" topping the list at 341 mentions. Alongside the classics, many innovative fusion dishes also made their mark, including desserts like milk tea and smoothies, as well as dishes inspired by Japanese, Korean, and Southeast Asian cuisines.</p>

                            <div class="flourish-embed flourish-hierarchy" data-src="visualisation/20474743"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script><noscript><img src="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/20474743/thumbnail" width="100%" alt="hierarchy visualization" /></noscript></div>
                            <p>This shift signals a slow but steady evolution in Boston Chinatown’s visual and cultural landscape. While tradition remains at the core, these restaurants are embracing change, merging heritage with modernity. The changes in these restaurants also reflect the fact that the Chinese food industry in the U.S. is keenly aware of the changing needs of the youthful, modernized market and is making changes to keep up with the times.</p>

                            <h2>Navigating the Evolving Food Delivery Landscape in the US</h2>
                            <p>With more than 5 million Chinese in the US, the dining needs of the Chinese community were huge. However, mainstream food delivery platforms such as Grubhub and Postmates did not provide adequate information on Chinese restaurants and services for Chinese consumers. The founders of Hungry Panda and Fantuan, platforms specializing in Asian food delivery, recognized these demands and rapidly expanded their delivery services in the US market after the COVID-19 pandemic. While many Chinese restaurants have joined these platforms, some have yet to make the transition. </p>
                            <p>Pho Pasteur, founded in 1991, is one of the restaurants in Boston Chinatown that has not joined either the Hungry Panda or Fantuan. “We got used to the old platforms like DoorDash and Grubhub, and we didn’t want to change,” said Huy, a staff at Pho Pasteur. “If there are more needs on those new platforms, we’d like to join.”</p>
                            <p>Jade Garden, a seafood restaurant with a history of 29 years, has joined both Hungry Panda and Fantuan.
                                “Before the advent of the Hungry Panda and Fantuan, there were already some food delivery platforms. But after the pandemic, the need for takeout surged, and more platforms emerged. We wanted to be in tune with the trend and meet customers’ needs, so we joined Hungry Panda and Fantuan, ” said Tam, a staff at Jade Garden. These restaurants that have run for a long time still accommodate the emerging delivery platforms, which allows them to capture consumers’ hearts. </p>
                            <p>In the vibrant culinary landscape of the U.S., Chinese restaurants offer more than just authentic flavors. They also embody stories about a rich culture and foster a sense of community. Ranging from budget-friendly to high-end, and from traditional to innovative, they transcend cultural boundaries and are beloved by diverse customers. </p>
                            <p>In every bite, these restaurants carry the flavors of history and the promise of innovation, reminding us that the story of Chinese cuisine in America is, at its heart, a story of resilience, creativity, and connection.</p>

							<h2>Pointing has no control about the blind texts</h2>
							<p>Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large <a href="#">language</a> ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth.</p>
							<p>She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and made herself on the way. When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a last view back on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline of Alphabet Village and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane. Pityful a rethoric question ran over her cheek, then she continued her way.</p>
